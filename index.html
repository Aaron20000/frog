      <p id="frog2"> video games like the ps4 spider man is awesome! and in the top 3 most favorite games, minecaft and roblox are super cool as well </p>
          <break>
            <p id="frog2">but i've mostly been playing spider man bacuse i have been makeing proggress on it and now that i finished it (the main story) </p>
             <break>
               <p id="frog2"> i want the spiderman game miles morales, becuase both spiderman games w=have like the best graghic, and when you web swing, like in the lego vistion, you dont just shoot a web in the air and thats it, you shoot a web at a building and stuff and thats way harder to code and caculate instead of just shooting a web in the air and your on the web forever </p>
               <break>
                 <p id="frog2">
                   and thers dodge times and theres so many different combonations of moves  and things that its a bit to crazy, but the game 5 star </p>
                 <break>
                   <p id="frog2">
                     and i supper really hope the spider man miles morales is an awesome game to with five star, but i want no spoilers it,
